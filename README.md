# Masters-thesis [Draft]

It is easy to see that every planar graph is a minor of another planar graph of maximum degree 3. Georgakopoulos proved that every finite K$_5$-minor free graph is a minor of another K$_5$-minor-free graph of maximum degree 22, and inquired if this is smallest possible. 
\\
This motivates the following generalization: Let $C$ be a minor-closed class. What is the minimum $k$ such that any graph in $C$ is a minor of a graph in $C$ of maximum degree $k$? Denote the minimum by $Δ(C)$ and set it to be $\infty$ if no such $k$ exists. We prove that $Δ(Forb(K_5))=3$, and proceed to find $Δ(C)$ for various minor closed classes $C$. We further explore properties of this parameter and in doing so connect it with the literature.
\\
A graph class is proper if it does not include all graphs. Our main and by far most significant result is that a minor-closed class $C$ excludes an apex graph as a minor if and only if there exists a proper minor-closed superclass $C'$ of $C$ with $Δ(C')=3$ if and only if there exists a proper minor-closed superclass $C'$ of $C$ with finite $Δ(C')$. This complements a list of 5 other characterizations of the minor-closed classes excluding an apex graph by Dujmovic, Morin and Wood. Furthermore, we extend and simplify Markov and Shi's result that not every graph of treewidth $\leq$ k has a degree 3 expansion of treewidth $\leq k$. Finally, we simplify Georgakopoulos' proof on the existence of a countable universal graph of $Forb(K_5)$.
